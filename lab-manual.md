**Step 2: Send Events to your hub**

In this step, you will simulate 3 devices and send data to your IoT Hub

1.  In your IoT hub, go to “IoT devices” and click on “+ Add”

![](media/63cfca44a7a34ec19f09ae1cb2eece78.png)

2.  Enter “device1” in the “deviceId” textbox and click save (you can leave the
    default settings enabled)

![](media/70d532568688930ba63302ca3f1f3f35.png)

3.  You need to save the primary connection string for the device. Go to “IoT
    devices” and click on “device 1”

![](media/4bb1bcf6363e055b2ec93c4cf9ca1e19.png)

4.  Save the “Connection String (primary key)” for this device. You are going to
    use this endpoint to send events.

![](media/6bb59c9e69cbae98a9f27b3461b72c24.png)

5.  Repeat the same steps (step 1 – 4) to create 2 new devices with Ids: “device
    2” and “device 3”. Save their primary connection strings as well

6.  To send events you will need a Raspberry Pi web simulator. Go to
    [https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator/\#GetStarted](https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator/)

7.  In the “coding area”, replace the placeholder text in Line 15 with the
    device1 connection string that you saved. (Step 4)

![](media/81c323627a04f5b45bb368c7e273cb1d.png)

8.  Click on “Run” at the bottom right of the page to execute the code. You
    should see messages being sent to the hub.

7.  You will receive a notification once the deployment has completed
    successfully.

**Step 4: Explore data in your TSI Environment**

In this section, you will perform basic analysis on your new TSI environment.

1.  Go to your Azure Time Series Insights Preview explorer by selecting the URL
    from the resource page in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

![](media/15b6dddd4a3b1ce452b106dd2211b1f1.png)

2.  Wait for the environment to load in the browser. Once it loads, on the
    left-hand pane, expand “Time Series Instances” to see all the time series in
    the environment.

![](media/8cd46322d2536e5695dd62d902d41a7f.png)

3.  Click on the first time series “device1” and then click on “Show humidity”.
    You will see a time series chart to the right. EventCount, humidity,
    messageId and temperature are the default variables created in the
    environment. Details can be found in “Step 5: Analyze data by defining a
    Model” the section below.

![](media/3b90e086cebcb0f5a0cdad41df584126.png)

4.  Repeat the same step with “device 2” and “device 3” to compare different
    time series.

![](media/daa57ca2a617bf710b2a5c1b33780a60.png)

**Step 5: Contextualize and Analyze data**

In the previous section, you explored raw data without contextualization. In
this section, you will add time series model entities to contextualize your IoT
data.

Time Series Model (preview) has 3 components: Types, Hierarchies and Instances.

-   *Types* allow users to define calculations and aggregates over raw telemetry
    data and specify a tag for the sensor (example: Temperature sensor, Pressure
    sensor). In this lab you will use the ‘default type’ that performs a count
    operation.

-   *Hierarchies* allow users to specify the structure of their assets. For
    example, an organization has buildings and buildings have rooms which
    contain IoT devices. The hierarchy structure in this case will be (Building
    -\> Room).

-   *Instances* enrich incoming IoT data with device metadata. An instance links
    to 1 type definition and multiple hierarchy definitions.

1.  In the upper left part of the explorer select the Model tab:

![](media/6e67fb5455d8a30caf2915c8b9503387.png)

2.  For this lab we will use the default Type created by TSI.

3.  The next step is to add a hierarchy. In the Hierarchies section, select +
    Add

    ![](media/884532b4f469699a602021e5b2d501fd.png)

4.  A tab will open on the right-hand side. Add the following values:

| Name    | Enter **Location Hierarchy** |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Level 1 | Enter City                   |
| Level 2 | Enter Building               |
| Level 3 | Enter Floor                  |

![](media/d00f689c350f8fc83ade29849912d35e.png)

Click “Create” at the bottom

5.  You will see a hierarchy created:

    ![](media/14e7642ed74f8cbc0959d26a5ec3c4cd.png)

6.  Next, click on “Instances” and click on “device 1”. To edit this Instance,
    click on “Edit”

    ![](media/c723f4a278b85115d733cfcb34139451.png)

7.  On the Right-Hand Side, enter the following fields

| **Type**        | Select **Default Type**        |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| **Name**        | Enter **“Chiller_1”**          |
| **Description** | Enter **any description**      |
| **Hierarchies** | Enable **Location Hierarchy**. |
| **City**        | Enter **Seattle**.             |
| **Building**    | Enter **Space Needle**.        |
| **Floor**       | Enter **Floor 40**             |

![](media/30fa0167fd9fbe4af72eef8287165413.png)

Click “Save”

8.  You will see the instances populated:

    ![](media/81af55a14705b54b777f40e9a9cfe706.png)

9.  Repeat step6 for device2 and device 3 with the following values:

    *Device 2:*

| **Type**        | Select **Default Type**           |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Name**        | Enter **“Chiller_2”**             |
| **Description** | Enter **any description**         |
| **Hierarchies** | Enable **Location Hierarchy**.    |
| **City**        | Enter **Seattle**.                |
| **Building**    | Enter **Pacific Science Center**. |
| **Floor**       | Enter **Floor 20**                |

*Device 3:*

| **Type**        | Select **Default Type**         |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| **Name**        | Enter **“Chiller_3”**           |
| **Description** | Enter **any description**       |
| **Hierarchies** | Enable **Location Hierarchy**.  |
| **City**        | Enter **New York**.             |
| **Building**    | Enter **Empire State Building** |
| **Floor**       | Enter **Floor 30**              |

10.  Navigate back to the “Analyze tab”. You will see a hierarchy that enables
    easy navigation and that provides context to the raw sensor data .

1.  Now navigate the hierarchy by going to “New York” -\> “Empire State
    Building” -\> “Floor 30”. Click on Chiller_3 and click on “Show humidity”

    ![](media/f73bfd1bfa65d511cb0d3815c8f4f189.png)

2.  To compare “Chiller_3” with “Chiller_2” humidity, add Chiller_2 humidity as
    follows:
